# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is part of a coding boot camp designed to help newcomers build a note taking app. I built this project to help me learn the basics of Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's an alternative note taking app that you can also update as you improve your coding skills.

## Usage

There's a notes section for each topic on the webpage. These are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It's also interactable through the DevTools console because it will list the topics and randomly choose one topic to study first.
